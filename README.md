Reporting issues
----------------
Issues submitted [here](https://github.com/kesava-wow/kuinameplates2/issues) won't necessarily receive a response, but I do read all of them.

When submitting an issue:
- Separate distinct issues into multiple tickets. It's easier to work with that way.
- Run this in chat: ``/knp dump``. It should open a window with some text including your current profile; copy that into your report.
- Remember I'm human. Though I do main a Draenei.

On pull requests
----------------
I'm unlikely to merge PRs. Translations should go in [CurseForge's localisation system](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/kuinameplates/localization).
